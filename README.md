# swqa-project3
This repository was created in coordinace with the guidlines set by my software testing and quality assurance project 3+4 assignment.

**Assignment 3+4:**
The objective of these assignments was create a pipeline process that utilizes tools and appplications to implement automated unit testing, end to end testing, acceptance testing, web interface testing. These tests should be conducted immediately as a result of implementing a continuous integration process. Afterwards, once testing has passed, the branches should be pushed to a backend/hosting platform.

A web interface should be assessible which hosts the products created by assignment 2 onto a cloud platform. 

**Implement the Following**
- [] Source Control -                Github
- [] Continuous Integration -        Travis CI
- [] Automated Unit Testing -        Travis CI
- [] Automated E-2-E Tests  -        Travis CI
- [] Static Analysis -               Sider
- [] Automatic Staging Deployment -  Heroku
- [] Manual Push to Production -     Heroku
- [] 3rd Party Code Coverage -       Coveralls

To explore the presented material in the lab report, it can be accessed as a document within the "Report" folder.
