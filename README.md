This repository was created in coordinace with the guidlines set by my software testing and quality assurance project 3+4 assignment.


**Assignment 3+4:**
The objective of these assignments was create a pipeline process that utilizes tools and appplications to implement automated unit testing, end to end testing, acceptance testing, web interface testing. These tests should be conducted immediately as a result of implementing a continuous integration process. Afterwards, once testing has passed, the branches should be pushed to a backend/hosting platform.

A web interface should be assessible which hosts the products created by assignment 2 onto a cloud platform. 

**Implement the Following:**
- [x] Source Control -                Github
- [x] Continuous Integration -        Travis CI
- [x] Automated Unit Testing -        Travis CI
- [x] Automated E-2-E Tests  -        Travis CI
- [x] Static Analysis -               Sider
- [x] Automatic Staging Deployment -  Heroku
- [x] Manual Push to Production -     Heroku
- [x] 3rd Party Code Coverage -       Coveralls
